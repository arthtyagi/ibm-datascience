# IBM-Data Science

IBM Data Science Professional Certificate notes, models and other helpful stuff.

This repository is on the 9 courses of Data Science offered by IBM as a part of the Professional Certifcate.

## This contains help for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Course

1. Notes
2. Models

There will be no solutions as that would be considered as cheating and I strongly oppose it. The models are just for learning purposes.

I hope this repository is helpful to you.
